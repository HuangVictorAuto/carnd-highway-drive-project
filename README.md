# CarND-Highway-Drive-Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

### Goals
In this project your goal is to safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. You will be provided the car's localization and sensor fusion data, there is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible, note that other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 10 m/s^3.

## Implementation
Following is a walk through of the important parts of my code that reach the goal.More details you can read the code directly.

### Information from the simulator

#### Simulator
You can download the Term3 Simulator which contains the Path Planning Project from the [releases tab (https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases/tag/T3_v1.2).  

To run the simulator on Mac/Linux, first make the binary file executable with the following command:
```shell
sudo chmod u+x {simulator_file_name}
```
#### The map of the highway is in data/highway_map.txt
Each waypoint in the list contains  [x,y,s,dx,dy] values. x and y are the waypoint's map coordinate position, the s value is the distance along the road to get to that waypoint in meters, the dx and dy values define the unit normal vector pointing outward of the highway loop.

The highway's waypoints loop around so the frenet s value, distance along the road, goes from 0 to 6945.554.

#### Main car's localization Data (No Noise)

["x"] The car's x position in map coordinates

["y"] The car's y position in map coordinates

["s"] The car's s position in frenet coordinates

["d"] The car's d position in frenet coordinates

["yaw"] The car's yaw angle in the map

["speed"] The car's speed in MPH

#### Previous path data given to the Planner

//Note: Return the previous list but with processed points removed, can be a nice tool to show how far along
the path has processed since last time. 

["previous_path_x"] The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator

["previous_path_y"] The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator

#### Previous path's end s and d values 

["end_path_s"] The previous list's last point's frenet s value

["end_path_d"] The previous list's last point's frenet d value

#### Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)

["sensor_fusion"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates. 

### Important code part
#### 1. Struct Car and releated functions
I have created a Car Sturcture in the helper.h file. I used this Car to save the information from the sensor fusion data: x,y,vx,vy,s,d using funciton sensed_car. And speed,lane,check_car_s was calculated for convinence use. init was used to confirm whether we have found a Car in a specific road or not.
I have also have two more functions,front_cloest,rear_cloest to obtain the front and rear Car in a specific lane. The status of the two Car is a important input to decide what my car should behave.

#### 2. Finite State and behavior plan
Lanekeep default state
If no car was detected within 30 meters ahead. The car should drive in lane and accelerate to the target speed 49.5mph and keep that speed.

Lanekeep follow state
If a front car was detected within 30 meters. And the car was driving not too slow(above 45mph). The car will try to follow the front car.The deacceleration and acceleration was controlled through a combination of the velocity difference between the car and front car and also a const max acc of 5m/s2.

Prepare lane change state
If a front car was detected within 30 meters. And the car was driving too slow(below 45mph).The car will first follow the front car. And search the left lane and right lane and try to make a lane change.

Lane change state
The left lane was a priority, as normally we pass a slow car through the fast lane. I check the beside lane. If the lane is with no car ahead. Or the front car is 20 meters aways and rear car is 10 meters behind. I think this is a safe conditon to make a lane change.

And according to different finite state, I will control the target lane and target velocity accordingly. This is a input for the later trajectory.

#### 3. Trajectory generator
The goal of the trajectory was to generate a smooth path with time for the car to follow.In this project a spline.h is used.The info I use to generate the next trajectory are the following.
The previous two points and the next 30,60,90 meter away points was used to generate the smooth spline.
The remaining points from the previous path was used for the next future path.
The left points in order to reach 50 points, were calculated through the velocity and the formed spline.
Then a continius and smooth tragectory was generated for the project.



## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./path_planning`.



## Details

1. The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every (x,y) point it recieves in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The (x,y) point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3. (NOTE: As this is BETA, these requirements might change. Also currently jerk is over a .02 second interval, it would probably be better to average total acceleration over 1 second and measure jerk from that.

2. There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. previous_path_x, and previous_path_y can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.
